# Trustpilot Widgets!

Hello there! So I've decided to upload my original solution in addition
to a couple of fun takes on said original.

## The Projects

### Original
The original solution to the frontend widget

### Original-React
The original solution to the frontend widget BUT in React

### Improved
The original solution to the frontend widget BUT in React BUT I decided
to use this as my "lets see what we can do" project

## DISCLAIMER
I knew the basics of React prior to all this but this is my first
fully fledged react app.
Advice would be MUCH appriciated. I've tried to
outline in comments where I feel potential issues may be or less that ideal
choices.

## Setup - SIMPLE!...if you have a Mac

1. git clone https://github.com/bpurslow/trustpilot-widget.git
2. Choose the directory of your choice (original, improved, original_react)
3. If you chose original
 1. Open index.html
 2. Done
4. If you chose improved/original_react
 1. Get yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
 2. In the directory of choice type: ```yarn```
 3. Wait for dependencies to install
 4. In the directory of choice type: ```yarn start```
 5. DONE! Go to http://localhost:8080/  in chrome
    * (by all means check other browsers but it's only optimised for chrome right now)
